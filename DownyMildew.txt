Description:
Downy mildew in lettuce, caused by the oomycete Bremia lactucae, manifests as pale, yellowish patches on the upper side of leaves, with a grayish, fuzzy mold on the underside. The disease can cause leaves to become distorted, and affected plants may experience stunted growth and premature bolting.

Cause:
Downy mildew thrives in cool, damp environments. It spreads through airborne spores and can be exacerbated by high humidity and poor air circulation.

Remedy:

Select resistant lettuce varieties if available.
Ensure good air circulation around plants by spacing them adequately.
Avoid overhead watering and use drip irrigation to keep foliage dry.
Remove and dispose of infected plants promptly.
Apply appropriate fungicides as a preventive measure or at the first sign of infection.
Each of these conditions requires different strategies to manage and prevent, but addressing the underlying causes and maintaining good cultural practices are key to keeping lettuce healthy.
